SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: Reads/SimulatedReads_XX.fq.gz
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC'
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 5 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp
File was specified to be an MspI-digested RRBS sample. Sequences with adapter contamination will be trimmed a further 2 bp to remove potential methylation-biased bases from the end-repair reaction
File was specified to be a non-directional MspI-digested RRBS sample. Sequences starting with either 'CAA' or 'CGA' will have the first 2 bp trimmed off to remove potential methylation-biased bases from the end-repair reaction

RUN STATISTICS FOR INPUT FILE: Reads/SimulatedReads_XX.fq.gz
=============================================
250 sequences processed in total
Sequences were truncated to a varying degree because of deteriorating qualities (Phred score quality cutoff: 20):	2 (0.8%)
Sequences removed because they became shorter than the length cutoff of 20 bp:	0 (0.0%)
RRBS reads trimmed by additional 2 bp when adapter contamination was detected:	0 (0.0%)
RRBS reads trimmed by 2 bp at the start when read started with CAA (2) or CGA (0) in total:	2 (0.8%)
